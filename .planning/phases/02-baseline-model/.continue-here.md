<current_state>
Phase 2 planning is COMPLETE. Four plans created and verified, ready for execution.
User ran `/gsd:list-phase-assumptions 2` and confirmed all assumptions are correct.
Plans have been updated to be migration-focused (code exists in notebook).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 1 (Data Pipeline): Complete, UAT passed (6/6 tests)
- Phase 2 discussion: Complete, CONTEXT.md created with loss weights (0.5/0.5) and training feedback decisions
- Phase 2 research: Complete, RESEARCH.md created with implementation patterns
- Phase 2 planning: Complete, 4 plans created (02-01 through 02-04)
- Phase 2 plan verification: PASS
- Assumptions review: User confirmed all assumptions correct
- Plans updated: Changed from "implement from scratch" to "migrate from notebook"
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Execute Plan 02-01: Migrate ConvBlock, DeconvBlock, SSIMLoss, CombinedLoss (3 tasks)
- Execute Plan 02-02: Migrate SAREncoder, SARDecoder, SARAutoencoder (3 tasks)
- Execute Plan 02-03: Migrate Trainer with TensorBoard, checkpointing (3 tasks)
- Execute Plan 02-04: Create training script, run training, verify (3 tasks)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Loss weights: 0.5 MSE + 0.5 SSIM (from CONTEXT.md, not notebook's 1.0/0.1)
- SSIM window: 11x11 standard
- TensorBoard: Log scalars + images every epoch, weight histograms every 10 epochs
- Progress bar: Show loss + PSNR + SSIM + ETA
- GPU memory: Log in epoch summary
- Training logs: Save to file (in addition to TensorBoard)
- Source code: Migrate from learningnotebooks/phase4_sar_codec/day2_no_references.ipynb
- EdgePreservingLoss: NOT in Phase 2 scope (optional extra for later)
- Epochs: Variable, adjust to meet PSNR >25 dB target
</decisions_made>

None - ready to execute

<context>
User has working implementations in notebook (day2_no_references.ipynb):
- Cell 4: ConvBlock
- Cell 7: SAREncoder
- Cell 10: DeconvBlock
- Cell 13: SARDecoder
- Cell 16: SARAutoencoder
- Cell 19: SSIMLoss
- Cell 23: CombinedLoss
- Cell 34: Trainer

The source files (src/models/, src/losses/, src/training/) are stubs with NotImplementedError.
Task is to migrate notebook code to source files, preserving docstrings/type hints from stubs.

Important: Check phase 4 notebooks for later phases before assuming code doesn't exist.
</context>

<next_action>
Run: /gsd:execute-phase 2

This will execute 4 plans in sequence (wave 1-4), migrating all code from notebook to source files and training the baseline model.
