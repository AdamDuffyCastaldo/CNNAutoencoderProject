<current_state>
Phase 2 Plan 02-04 (Training) is in progress. Two models being trained:
1. Baseline (2.3M params): COMPLETED - val_psnr=20.47 dB, val_ssim=0.646 @ 50 epochs
2. ResNet-Lite (5.6M params): TRAINING NOW with AMP enabled

ResNet-Lite training was just started and is running overnight.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 02-01: Building Blocks + Losses - COMPLETE
- Plan 02-02: Model Architecture - COMPLETE
- Plan 02-03: Trainer Implementation - COMPLETE (added AMP support)
- Plan 02-04: Training - IN PROGRESS
  - Baseline training: COMPLETE (50 epochs, val_psnr=20.47 dB)
  - ResNet-Lite architecture: COMPLETE (src/models/resnet_autoencoder.py)
  - ResNet-Lite training notebook: COMPLETE (notebooks/train_resnet.ipynb)
  - ResNet-Lite training: RUNNING (started, training overnight)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Wait for ResNet-Lite training to complete
- Compare ResNet-Lite vs Baseline results in TensorBoard
- If neither reaches 25 dB target, consider U-Net or other improvements
- Create 02-04-SUMMARY.md after training completes
- Update STATE.md with final metrics
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Loss weights: 0.5 MSE + 0.5 SSIM (from CONTEXT.md)
- TRAIN_SUBSET=0.20 for faster iteration (20% of data)
- batch_size=32 for both models
- ResNet-Lite uses base_channels=32 (~5.6M params vs full ResNet 22M params)
- AMP (Mixed Precision) enabled for ~2x speedup
- Training via Jupyter notebook (user preference, not terminal scripts)
- Subset applies to BOTH train and val datasets proportionally
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just waiting for ResNet-Lite training to complete overnight.
</blockers>

<context>
User wants to compare architectures to improve on baseline's 20.47 dB PSNR.
Target is >25 dB for Phase 2, >30 dB ultimately.

ResNet-Lite was chosen as middle ground:
- More capacity than baseline (5.6M vs 2.3M params)
- Faster than full ResNet (5.6M vs 22M params)
- Residual connections should help gradient flow and quality

Training notebooks:
- notebooks/train_baseline.ipynb (completed)
- notebooks/train_resnet.ipynb (running now)

TensorBoard logs:
- notebooks/runs/baseline_c16_fast/ (baseline results)
- notebooks/runs/resnet_lite_c16/ (resnet training in progress)

Checkpoints:
- notebooks/checkpoints/baseline_c16_fast/best.pth
- notebooks/checkpoints/resnet_lite_c16/ (will be created)

Roadmap updates made this session:
- Added JPEG-2000 comparison to Phase 3
- Added raw GeoTIFF support to Phase 5
- Added Phase 7: Deployment (ONNX, Docker, REST API)
</context>

<next_action>
1. Check if ResNet-Lite training completed: `cat notebooks/runs/resnet_lite_c16/training.log | tail -30`
2. Compare results in TensorBoard: `tensorboard --logdir=notebooks/runs`
3. If ResNet-Lite improves over baseline, proceed to create 02-04-SUMMARY.md
4. If still below target, discuss next steps (U-Net, more data, longer training)
