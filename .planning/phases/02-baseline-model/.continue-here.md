<current_state>
Phase 2 Plan 02-04 (Training) is in progress. ResNet-Lite v2 training ready to start.

User fixed the torch.compile() error - removed it since it has Windows compatibility issues.
Notebook is ready with EPOCHS=30, just needs to run.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 02-01: Building Blocks + Losses - COMPLETE
- Plan 02-02: Model Architecture - COMPLETE
- Plan 02-03: Trainer Implementation - COMPLETE
- Plan 02-04: Training - IN PROGRESS
  - Baseline training: COMPLETE (50 epochs, val_psnr=20.47 dB, val_ssim=0.646)
  - ResNet-Lite v1: COMPLETE (34 epochs, val_psnr=21.24 dB - NaN issue after epoch 24)
  - U-Net: ABANDONED (skip connections bypass bottleneck - not suitable for compression)
  - NaN fix in trainer: COMPLETE (float32 cast + skip logic)
  - ResNet-Lite v2 notebook: READY (EPOCHS=30, torch.compile removed due to Windows issue)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Run ResNet-Lite v2 training (~10-15 hours)
- Compare results with v1 (21.24 dB best)
- Write 02-04-SUMMARY.md after training
- Update STATE.md with final metrics
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- U-Net abandoned: skip connections pass features directly from encoder to decoder, bypassing bottleneck. With skips: 30 dB, without skips (true compression): 11 dB. Not suitable for compression.
- Stick with ResNet-Lite: residual blocks help gradient flow without bypassing bottleneck
- Speed optimizations: EPOCHS 50→30 (torch.compile removed - Windows incompatible)
- NaN fix applied to trainer: cast to float32 before loss computation, skip NaN batches
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - notebook is ready to run.

<context>
Training results so far:
- Baseline: 20.47 dB PSNR, 0.646 SSIM (2.3M params)
- ResNet-Lite v1: 21.24 dB PSNR, 0.725 SSIM (5.6M params) - but NaN appeared after epoch 24

Target: >25 dB PSNR for Phase 2 (aspirational, not blocking)

Key files:
- notebooks/train_resnet.ipynb - ResNet training (ready to run)
- src/training/trainer.py - NaN fix applied
- notebooks/checkpoints/resnet_lite_c16/best.pth - v1 checkpoint (valid)

Roadmap updates from earlier sessions:
- Added JPEG-2000 comparison to Phase 3
- Added raw GeoTIFF support to Phase 5
- Added Phase 7: Deployment

<next_action>
1. Open notebooks/train_resnet.ipynb
2. Restart kernel
3. Run all cells
4. Let training run (~10-15 hours)
